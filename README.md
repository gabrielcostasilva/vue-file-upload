# Vue File Upload
This project exemplifies the file upload feature with Vue.

Please note that the main branch does not implement any Vue feature. The ideia is that we start from the very basic to more elaborated implementations.

This branch is not based in any particular tutorial, but the Spring Boot app is based on [Escuela Technologies' YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW390W7M6TM).

## Project Overview

This project consists of a Java + Spring Boot app that receives a file upload request to process, and a Vue app that submit the file request.
